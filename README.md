# martink-How-to-build-Advanced-Web-Based-Canvas-Tool-for-Automata-Theory-Testing
## About
AT-TA is a web-based software designed for testing the application of automata theory content. This canvas-based tool currently offers the capability to evaluate a user's proficiency in creating equivalent NFA/DFA for a given regular expression.

##How it Works
The program generates a random regular expression that the user must convert to NFA/DFA on the canvas. The drawn NFA/DFA should accept the exact language as the generated regular expression. Afterward, the user can verify whether their diagram accepts the same language as the regex. The program allows users to generate new regular expressions repeatedly to keep testing their skills.

##Running the Program
To run the program, there is no need to install any extra libraries. The user needs to open the HTML file in a browser and make sure that the CSS and JavaScript files are in the same directory as the HTML file.
